# gonerator
A simple Go microservice boilerplate.

## Usage
Probably you have already done but it's good to remind one thing to you before diving into boilerplate generation. You should have already installed Go and had $GOPATH on your environment.

After the assumption made above, we are good to go creating our first microservice boilerplate.

1. Install all dependencies
```
$ npm install
```

2. Change directory and link
```
$ cd generator-gonerator
$ npm link
```

3. Run the boilerplate generator.
```
$ yo gonerator
```
